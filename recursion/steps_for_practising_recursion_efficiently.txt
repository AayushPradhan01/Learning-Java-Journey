1) Identify if the problem can be broken down to smaller problems.
2) Write the recurrence relation if needed.
3) Draw the recursive tree.
4) About the tree:-
    i) See the flow of functions and how they are getting in stack.
   ii) Identify the flow in left tree calls and right tree calls.
  iii) Draw the tree and position again and again using pen and paper.
   iv) Use a debugger to see the flow.

5) See how the values, and what type if values(int, String etc.) are
   returned at each step and see where the function calls will come
   out of. In the end, you will come out of the main function.

NOTE:-  A very important thing is to identify these 3 things.
        i) Arguments.
       ii) Return type.
      iii) Body of the function.

A Very Important Point!! :-
                          Make sure that you RETURN the recursion call if there is a RETURN TYPE.
